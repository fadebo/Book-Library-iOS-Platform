# LibraryApp
. Introduction: - 
1.1 Purpose: -
• The purpose of this document is to assist in understanding the background 
procedure and operational flow of the platform. It consists of four simplified 
components including a user interface design, wireframes, the SQL databases, and 
the flow chart.
1.2 Intended use and audience:-
• The intended audience for this platform is students and staff who want to assess the 
school library from their mobile devices. 
1.3 Problem Solving:-
• As of the date this project proposal was written there has not been a single local 
library application for students and staff to access the books they want or to check if 
a book is available on campus.
• It provides efficiency and more convenience than allowing students and staff to have 
to go to the library in person to confirm if a book was there and go back empty￾handed if it wasn’t.
• Students don’t have information about the book they are searching for, so this app 
makes it easier and faster to know book details.
• Students may need books that are not available on the library system so we can 
recommend them based on the title of the search.
• Students may need to borrow a book, but it might end up being given to someone 
who arrived at the library first, so the app makes it more convenient to reserve the 
book they want.
• Inform Students about the book, if it is currently needed back at the library or if the 
time of borrowing the book has ended
